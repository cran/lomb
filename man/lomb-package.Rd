Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
}
\description{
The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is the most wideley used method to detect even weak periodoc components in unequally sampled time series.  It can also be used for equally sampled time series.

Function \code{\link{lsp}} computes the Lomb-Scargle periodogram for unevenly sampled times series (e.g., series with missing data).  P-values for the highest peak in the periodogram are computed from the exponential distribution.  Alternatively, function \code{\link{randlsp}} computes a p-value for the largest peak in the periodogram by repeatedly randomising the time-series sequence.  Both functions allow setting the range of frequencies to be inspected, as well as the stepsize (oversampling factor) used for frequency scanning.
